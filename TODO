Pressing issues and concerns.

Models -
    + getTorrent should just return the referred to Torrent instance,
                 or a list of Torrent instances; the other info can be inferred from that
    + Client -
        + Play with conversation, first. Create simple terminal torrent
                 program to see how the client will/should "expect" the tracker to behave
    + Torrent - 
        + See Client

Views -
    + Front should display a list of active clients for debugging purposes
    + handle_torrent needs some serious error checking
    + Announce should check client existence and add lacking ones
    + Scrape should allow multiple info-hashes, or none at all
